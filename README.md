# Landmark-detection

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for detecting landmarks in images using machine learning or deep learning techniques. It explores a workflow for training and evaluating a model to identify and locate specific landmarks.


## Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Steps to preprocess images and annotations for landmark detection.
2. Model Architecture: Custom or pre-trained model used for detecting landmarks.
3. Training and Validation: Workflow to train the model on labeled data, and evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or accuracy.
4. Visualization: Plotting predictions and ground truth landmarks on images for qualitative analysis.
